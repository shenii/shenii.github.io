## About



My research focuses on the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases and invasions. I am broadly interested in the evolutionary ecology of parasites with the overall goal of understanding how disease organisms spread, persist, and affect their host populations. 

My current work seeks to understand how multiple infections impact evolutionary outcomes in spatially structured host populations. I am utillzing experimental evolution and mathematical modeling approaches to understand how pathogens modify virulence evolution in changing environments. 

I completed my PhD in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Michigan under the mentorship of [John Vandermeer](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/faculty/jvander.html). For my dissertation, I combined mathematical and empirical approaches to study the effects of spatial competitive networks on species coexistence patterns. Since 2017, I am an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in Biology working with [Mike Boots](https://ib.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/bootsm) in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California Berkeley.
